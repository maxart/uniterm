// Priorities: a title marker beats any grid text (110 to 100), blocked
// prompts beat activity (90 to 85), activity is anchored to a spinner or a
// line start so typed prompt text cannot impersonate it (75 to 60), and idle
// hints are the weakest positive signal (20 to 10). No rule matching means
// idle: the matcher never treats output volume as evidence.
